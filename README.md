# Building a REST API for CRUD operations with Node JS, Express and UUID.

REST API based CRUD web app to learn and better understand Express, routes and controllers.

## Functionality

- Create Users using JSON and adding users to an array. 
- Setup a Unique ID per created user using UUID.
- Get Users to pars all of the user objects in the array to the page.
- Update user data using the UUID of the user
- Delete User(s) 


## Possible improvements
- Adding a DB for persistant user data storage. (this is planned for another project)
